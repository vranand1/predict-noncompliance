    **DS/ML Engineer Access Control & Data Handling:**

    *   **Tool Access:** Granted access to specialized development environments (IDEs, Notebooks), MLOps platforms, model registries, feature stores, and ML pipeline orchestration tools.
    *   **Data Access:** Access to data required for model building, training, validation, and monitoring. This may include:
        *   **Pseudonymized/De-identified Data:** Used where possible to minimize PHI exposure during development and testing.[5]
        *   **Protected Health Information (PHI):** Access to identifiable PHI within secure, audited environments may be granted when strictly necessary for specific tasks (e.g., debugging model performance for specific patient cases, certain types of feature engineering), governed by BAAs, data use agreements, and HIPAA's minimum necessary standard.
    *   **Purpose:** Focus is on the technical lifecycle of AI/ML models â€“ development, training, validation, deployment, monitoring, and retraining.
    *   **Compliance:** All activities involving PHI must adhere to HIPAA regulations and organizational security policies.
